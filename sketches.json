#0715cd;\">EB: sally from the movie is named after a lou reed album, called the same thing.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: and there is a song in it, called the same thing.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: apparently it was based on different night clubs lou reed was visiting.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: and sally was the name of the manager of a bar he went to a lot!</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: oh huh</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: cool</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: \"sally maggio,

#e00707;\">TG: guess it is</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: and how it relates back to the movie, too. heheh. it makes sense now.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: yeah i can kinda see it</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: she was a trains woman, but now sally can't-dance was in an airplane!</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: it is making

came up with</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: no, she was in an airplane. i just said that.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: oh my god</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: john</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: okay</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: let me spew a little lore about your old pal tg</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: you know my bro right</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: yeah?</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: okay this might blow your fucking mind a bit</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: he was born and he was gonna be a girl</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: but he decided he was too cool and manly for that life and ended up getting that female puberty skewered in its fucking tracks</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: woah.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: train tracks?</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: john are you playing dumb on purpose</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: for that specific one, yes.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: but i am not getting your metaphor.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: its not a metaphor</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: ugh</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: he literally was genetically going to be a girl and then he decided to not do that</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: which is called trans gender</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: my bro is trans gender</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: ohhhh.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: no trains.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: no trains dude</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: not one</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: disappointing! but i am getting it.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: so is he actually a girl?</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: no</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: i get that youre doing the confused ally bit right now</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: hes a guy and if that isnt the most obvious shit in the world i dont know how to tell you anything more</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: its like</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: i dunno. can you change your gender in the ghostbusters mmo</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: it costs like twenty bucks to redo character creation.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: which is really annoying, but you get to do all of it over again.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: okay so it was like that</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: but instead of twenty bones one time you end up spending like hundreds on expensive fucking specialty doctors and surgeries and shit</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: in the end it all worked out though</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: youll hear me give my bro a lot of fucking shit but you wont hear me say he didnt genuinely sit me down and explain this shit</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: laced with a bit more casual misogyny than id expect from pretty much anyone else in the trans community but it was a longer convo than the one he gave me about the birds and bees so</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: or maybe lil cal was the one to do the misogyny i dunno</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: the fucking puppet was pretty unwelcome and i gotta be real who said what blurred in my memory but it was one of the most pretty much okay interactions ive had with him when hes with cal</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: not that cal isnt sweet as hell</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: love that guy</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: haha</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: you have said a lot of words and i am going to take a minute to process them.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: yeah thats fair</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: lol</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: just got the mental image that fred savage from little monsters couldve pissed in my apple juice</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: tg, you are kind of overwhelming me!</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: gotcha</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: moratorium on rambles begins now</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: okay, so i am kind of understanding what this is. it is like if you adopt a boy rabbit, but then have him in a pen with another boy rabbit, only to find out that your boy rabbit was actually a girl rabbit the whole time, because now she is pregnant, and you have to hide the baby bunnies before everyone else comes home!</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: i guess</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: more that the boy rabbit decided to be a girl rabbit because being a boy rabbit wasnt working out</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: but flipped genderwise</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: that makes sense, i think.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: and you need the surgeries in order to do trans gender.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: no</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: really?</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: yeah</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: wait, how are you sure?</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: john youre never gonna believe this one</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: speaking from firsthand experience</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: you do not need surgery to be trans</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: lol</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: but i thought you said that your bro had surgery!</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: yes</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: he did</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: but i</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: did not</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: i am confused again.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: egbert if this is causing you this much of a nervous fucking breakdown to consider the actual literal words of what i said</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: like i dunno man maybe you are just hopeless</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: oh no. did i say something wrong?</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: i don't want to make you mad, tg.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: heh</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: tg</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: like trans gender</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: i thought it stood for turntech godhead.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: it does</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: im transgender</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: i thought your bro was transgender!</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: no thats our shortstop</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: okay</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: lol</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: john</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: more than one person can be transgender</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: for example</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: the woman named sally whatsherface</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: who inspired the lou reed song</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: that named the lou reed album</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: which named the character from the film con air</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: pff, i knew that.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: i just thought that...</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: oh.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: wait, you're trans??</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: oh my god</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: yes dude</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: literally</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: you were right the dick jokes WERE projection</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: oh man.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #0715cd;\">EB: i hope i didn't screw anything up.</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: nah</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: its cool</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: i was gonna let you know at some point</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: just didnt really come up</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: not like we measure each others dicks up that often</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: even though ive heard its a pretty common activity</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: egbert youre cis you gotta let me in on the big secret</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: is it true</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: do they really pass out free measuring tapes to every little boy in the hospital</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: marking that shit off day by day</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: im sorry, they tell my bro, but this kid has -1</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: -1 says bro</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: yeah dude somethings kinda weird about him</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: cant place it though</span> <br> <span style=\"color: #e00707;\">TG: then the dickmeasuring guy winks because
